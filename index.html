			EARLY COLLEGE ACCESS PROGRAM</h1>
		<p style="font-weight:140%;font-size:1.3em;color:white">
			AACPS and Anne Arundel Community College (AACC) are joint sponsors of the Early College Access Programs (ECAP). This program encourages students, who are 16+ years-old, to enroll into college credit bearer courses at AACC. Students may take any course from the AACC course catalog for credit in one of their programs or for use as transfer credits at another accredited college. This allows for students to get a jumpstart on their college credits while also providing opportunity to further explore career interests. Students may also select courses from the AACPS list of approved &quot;Dual Credit&quot; courses, which would allow for them to earn both college and AACPS high school credit for the same course. Speak to your school counselor for more information on the ECAP program.</p>

			ECAP Courses by Career Field of Interest</h2>
		<p style="font-weight:140%;font-size:1.3em;">
			In 9th grade every student completes the career cluster finder, a survey which compares the student's career interest profile to different career industries. Upon completing this survey students added clusters and jobs into their Naviance profile. When a student considers which courses to take throught the ECAP program they are encouraged to go back to their selections and review the "Plan of Study" for their chosen careers. You may use the following links to review your current selected career intersts as well as to research new interests and clusters.</p>
