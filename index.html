      <p style="font-weight:140%;font-size:1.3em;">AACPS and Anne Arundel Community College (AACC) are joint sponsors of the Early College Access Programs (ECAP). This program encourages students, who are 16+ years-old, to enroll into college credit bearer courses at AACC. Students may take any course from the AACC course catalog for credit in one of their programs or for use as transfer credits at another accredited college. This allows for students to get a jumpstart on their college credits while also providing opportunity to further explore career interests. Students may also select courses from the AACPS list of approved "Dual Credit" courses, which would allow for them to earn both college and AACPS high school credit for the same course.</p>
